TODO list:

1. Allow user to select character (1 of 4)
2. Winning condition: User must make it to space containing Selector.png after picking up Heart.png
3. Picking up Key.png will open either one door (Tall Door.png) or one chest (Chest Closed.png)
4. Picking up Star.png will multiple all currently held items (i.e. if a key and gem were picked up then the star the user will now hold 2 keys and 2 gems)
5. Holding a gem defeats one enemy and takes away one gem from inventory in doing so
6. Display inventory at the top-left of the page
7. Potentially have levels auto-generate by checking that gems possible = enemies, keys possible = closed doors/chests, and Selector.png is reachable
8. Create a few mockup levels for play, winning one level proceeds to the next
